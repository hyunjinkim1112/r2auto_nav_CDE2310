## Description
The ZelephantBot, developed by NUS IDP students from CDE2310, is a modified Turtlebot 3 originally provided by Robotis Co. Our modifications consist of adding a heat-detection and a flywheel ball launching system to accomplish the mission objectives which are - Autonomous navigation within a closed and connected maze, locating three heat sources (humans), and launching ping-pong balls vertically upwards in a pre-programmed sequence. 

This repository contains all the code that we have used for our Zelephant Bot in Ubuntu 22.04.5, ROS2 Humble and Python3 to explore a closed and connected maze using a Naive Global Wavefront Frontier with Breadth-First Search. 
Do check out our project report under the [Documentations](add link here) folder for more details on how we have developed our ZelephantBot. 

## File Organisation
- [Documentations](add link) folder contain all the documentation we have made for the ZelephantBot. This includes the project report, assembly manual, full software setup guide and the end user documentation.
